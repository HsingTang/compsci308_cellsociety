Features implemented:
# Simulation
* Allowing for a different number of neighbor rearrangements:
The XML file can contain a list of integers that act
as indices to indicate which possible neighbors for a cell
should be included.
* Allowing for a different variety of grid location shapes:
We currently have functionality to support either square or
triangle cells.
* Allowing for different grid edge types:
Our program currently allows either finite or toroidal edge types.
* Implement additional simulations:
We implemented the RPS simulation.
